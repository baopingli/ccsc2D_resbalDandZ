# 2-3D Learning

This folder contains the code required for learning hyperspectral dictionaries, example filters, and code for demosaicing hyperspectral data.
All code is located in the appropriate folders.

## Training Data

There are many sources for hyperspectral training data. In our experiments we used images from the following data sets:

* Frequency of metamerism in natural scenes (http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/d.h.foster/Hyperspectral_images_of_natural_scenes_02.html, http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/d.h.foster/Hyperspectral_images_of_natural_scenes_04.html)
* Real-World Hyperspectral Images Database (http://vision.seas.harvard.edu/hyperspec/download.html)
